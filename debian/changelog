    - Update some locales
  Don't ask why pcmanfm didn't support those listed basic features in
  previous releases. GTK+ has very few supports for those things and its
  default behavior isn't suitable for more complicated applications. So,
  those listed features are coded by the author of PCManFM line by line,
  which is very time-consuming...
  However, after endless hacking, we got them. Cheers!

pcmanfm (0.4.1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    - Totally rewrite the desktop icon support. It's much nicer and
      also faster than the old one.
    - Support hotkeys on the desktop
    - Support sorting desktop icons by name, size, mtime, and file type.
    - Able to use the desktop root menu provided by window manager (This
      option can be turned on from the preference dialog).
    - Drop shadow on desktop item text.
    - Totally rewrite the wallpaper support. Now there are several
      different modes: extend, tile, or center the image.
    - Daemon mode support. Run pcmanfm with -d argument can run
      pcmanfm as daemon, and it will start much faster later.
    - Image preview is shown in "Open File" dialog when selecting
      wallpaper.
    - Handle mount/umount/eject much more gracefully. If root access is
      needed, now gksu will be called automatically, and the volumes can
      be mounted correctly after typing the password.
    - Fix memory leaks in desktop window.
    - Fix crashes when gtk+ theme changes on the fly.
    - Use separate config files under LXDE.
    - Added "Create New" in desktop menu.
    - Optimize xml files.
    - Support "Compact List View".
    - Update locales.
  * Removed Asho Yeh <asho@debian.org.tw> from co-maintainer field due
    no response for a long time.

pcmanfm (0.3.5.23-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New maintainer(Closes:#454278)
  * New upstream release (Closes:#447229,#443988,#460574)
    - Fix incorrect title of windows.
    - Show icons of *.desktop files in every folder.
    - Slightly improve path entry.
    - Resolve paths with '~' and '.', '..' in command line arguments, if
      they are not expanded by shell.
    - Show lines in dir tree if gtk+ > 2.10.
    - Add drop down menu for "back" and "forward" buttons.
    - Open dir in new tab when middle clicking on dir tree.
    - Thumbnail support is re-written, and both the speed and stability
      are improved.
    - Completely re-written volume management, can mount/umount/eject
      volumes through HAL correctly now.
    - The underlying mime-type system was completely re-designed and
      re-written from scratch. Now it's faster, more robust, and more
      standard compliant. The memory usage was reduced, too. By
      installing a xml file to the shared-mime-database, mime-type
      detection was enhanced.
    - Add some new locales: tr, eu, ja
    - Folder views are correctly updated when files get deleted or
      created. Some FAM-related bugs were fixed.
    - Command line arguments handling was improved. Now you can open
      multiple files with pcmanfm through command line.
    - Correctly handle desktop directory in the side pane. (Get the
      path of desktop directory from ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs. Hide the
      item if the directory didn't exist.)
    - config files were moved to ~/.config/pcmanfm to follow the new
      standard.
    - Better-looking about dialog, a must-have for every program. :p
    - Left click on the text of path bar with 'Ctrl' key held down now
      brings you to parent folders quickly. Here is a DEMO on youtube.
      http://tw.youtube.com/watch?v=aGUOvSMWm6c
    - New shortcut keys are supported: Now both 'Alt+D' and 'Ctrl+L' can
      focus the path bar, and 'Backspace' brings you to parent folder.
    - Remove the useless "Address" label on the path bar.
    - Fix segfault in app chooser dialog.
    - Create dialog UI using new lightweight PtkUIXml system and
      *.glade files "without" libglade.
    - Decrease memory usage and size of executable file.
